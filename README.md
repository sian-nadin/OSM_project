# Open Street Map data wrangling

**Work in Progress** - Project For Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

Choose any area of the world in OpenStreeMap and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Thoroughly audit and clean your dataset, converting it from XML to CSV format. Then import the cleaned .csv files into a SQL database. After building your local database explore your data by running queries.
